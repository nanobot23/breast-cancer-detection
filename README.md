# breast-cancer-detection


The system uses three algorithms to detect the  present of cancer in a given sample of mammogram image :
Back Propagation
Support Vector Machine(SVM)
SVM with BGSA 


The  system  has the following sections  involved :

### 1. Radiologist Mode : 
In this mode the radiologist can diagnose  patients , by entering the data extracted from the mamography images . There are two modes first is where the user can diagnose a single patient and other where user can upload the data file and can dagnose multiple patients at a time. This provides a second opinion to the radiologist and hyence reducing the need of two radiologists.


### 2.Developer Mode: 
All the comparision of algorithms and parameter tuning is done here, All three algorithms can be tested here on the basis of there parameters and optimization can be done here . It also compares all the three algorithms and decides and genereates several graphs , 
It provides a friendly interface to the developer instead of changing the source code everytime,
It also generates scatter plot of different algrothims along with different performance measures like accuracy, recall and confusion matrix of the given test dataset.  The developer mode also allows to slect the data and cross validation percentage of the dataset used.
